# PaPL
Paper-based Programming Language (PaPL) is a form of tangible programming platform that leverages the ubiquity of paper in classrooms. This project focusses on the application in programming educational robots including Thymio, the DIY CreroBot, and the visual programming language ScratchJr. The platform makes use of standard cameras of tablets for easy adoption in today's classrooms and promotes group collaboration. The open-source framework also allows developers to create paper-based versions of existing programming languages.

The Android application version is available on github.com/Antho1426/papl-app for use with the CreroBot.
This repository contains the desktop version of the application. To use the application with Thymio, the user will have to install the Thymio Suite software (https://www.thymio.org/program/). Similarly for ScratchJr, the software can be found at (https://jfo8000.github.io/ScratchJr-Desktop/).
